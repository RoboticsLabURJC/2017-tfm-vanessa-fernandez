# Week 2: Follow line dataset


The final goal of the project is to make a follow-line using Deep Learning. For this it is necessary to collect data. For this reason, I have based on the code created for the follow-line practice of JdeRobot Academy (http://vanessavisionrobotica.blogspot.com/2018/05/practica-1-follow-line-prueba-2.html) in order to create a dataset. The created dataset contains the input images with the corresponding linear and angular speeds. In addition, a dataset has been created that contains images with a single row with the corresponding linear and angular speeds. The dataset is in: https://github.com/RoboticsURJC-students/2017-tfm-vanessa-fernandez/tree/master/follow%20line/dataset. In the file speeds.txt, in each line there is the linear speed and the angular speed corresponding to the image that is in the Image folder. The same goes for the row images that are in the Images_640_1 folder.
