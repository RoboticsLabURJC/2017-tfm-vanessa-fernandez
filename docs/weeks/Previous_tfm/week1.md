# Week 1: Read old works

After that, I have to know the state of the art of Deep Learning, so I've read the old works from other students. First, I read the Nuria Oyaga's Final Grade Project: "An√°lisis de Aprendizaje Profundo con la plataforma Caffe". Then, I read the the David Pascual's Final Grade Project: "Study of Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras Framework". Finally, I read an introduction to Deep Learning.
