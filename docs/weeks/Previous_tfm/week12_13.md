# Weeks 12, 13: GUI with C++, Reinstall DetectionSuite

## Reinstall DetectionSuite

This week, I reinstalled Darknet and DetectionSuite. You can find the installation information in the following [link](https://github.com/JdeRobot/dl-DetectionSuite/blob/master/DeepLearningSuite/Dockerfile/Dockerfile). 


## GUI with C++

This week, I created some GUIs and I followed [1](http://zetcode.com/gui/gtk2/introduction/) and [2](https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/stable/index.html.en).
